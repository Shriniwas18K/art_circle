we do not take the node modules folder due to its very large size
it causes time wastage in copying files

hence whenever we will open this project somewhere in vs code
then manually 
install there first nodejs ,

now open terminal of vscode and open the 
directory where project is copied and then there write 
step by step 


npm install vue@latest
 
npm install axios@latest

npm install firebase-tools -g 


these above three will be required to build and deploy the project
dont install bootstrap for this project ,we have used cdn in this project
now follow this video for hosting and deployment when modififcation is complete

the project that we will use there inside firebase google website
should have unique name and unique id also
that unique id is asked manually by firebase website
during creation of firebase project

that unique id is the domain name for the hosted app or website

for example for this webapp i have used here

project inside firebase website  :   pccoenewartcircle

project unique id:          pccoenewartcircle

hence our hosted webiste got link as automatically

https://pccoenewartcircle.web.app/
